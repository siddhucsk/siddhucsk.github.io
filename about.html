                I am siddharth. Currently a university student at christ
                university bangalore pursuing my bachelor of arts degree in
                Communication & Media, English and Psychology. When I am not a
                University student, I pursue my various interests from design,
                film making, minimalism, productivity sports, psychology and
                entrepreneurship.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-4">
                I have had the opportunity to have lived in three cities namely
                Bangalore, chennai and mangalore. Although all located in the
                south of India, I have had different cultural, social and
                linguistic experiences I could learn from which have in turn
                shaped my personality.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-4">
                I have attended two schools in my short lifetime. The schools I
                attended are Cambridge School, Mangalore and Sri Sankara Senior
                Secondary School, Chennai. Both schools have taught me a
                plethora of knowledge, nurtured relationships and instilled
                values. Both my schools were also an outlet to explore my
                creative pursuits, sports and other athletic talents. 
            </p>

            <p class="fs-4">
                Writing an about me page is challenging, given it requires
                downsizing bundles of data about myself into a couple words to
                keep the reader hooked. My roundabout solution is to divide it
                into sections, which will reduce your reading effort.

                        <p class="fs-5">
                            I love sports. My favourite sports include cricket,
                            badminton, table tennis, tennis, volleyball and yes
                            i have played them all. My favourite sportspersons
                            are virat kohli and ms dhoni. Virat kohli has been
                            an archetype i admire and respect. His passion for
                            the sport, determination, grit and putting in
                            consistent effort to a long term goal has been
                            really inspiring to me. His aggressive nature on
                            the field has also taught me lessons, both good and
                            bad. Ms dhoni’s mind is a maze of mystery. His calm
                            analytical mind is what I admire the most

                        <p class="fs-5">
                            I indulge in watching bbc and american tv shows. My
                            favourites include Sherlock, Mr robot, the
                            mentalist, friends, the big bang theory, mad men,
                            the man in the high castle and the office. My
                            childhood was inspired by cartoon network and
                            nickelodeon shows including johnny brave, codename
                            kids next door, ben 10 series, beyblade, tom and
                            jerry, avatar the last airbender and many more.
                            Picking out favourite movies is really hard but
                            Zindagi na milegi dobara has to be one of my all
                            time favourite movies. When it comes to anime, i am
                            hardcore fan of naruto, i also happen to like
                            dragon ball z, death note and my current and new
                            favourite demon slayer. I am also an ardent fan of
                            the marvel and dc cinematic universes although i
                            lean more towards marvel for their superior movies.
                            I believe both marvel and dc have amazing
                            characters in their comics and both comics hold
                            equal value in my heart. My favourite characters
                            include, dr strange, spiderman, ironman and batman. 

                            With that we come to the conclusion of my about me
                            section. If there is anything you learned about me,
                            it's that I love to write about myself and I'm a
                            narcissistic. So if you read through my elaborate
                            essay, I thank you sincerely.
